<p class="no-indent">In presenting this book to the Public of useful Knitted and
Crochet Articles, I wish to give a few suggestions with regard
to the Wools used and the mode of washing them.</p>

<p>No Wool is so cheap as the best. It is false economy (I
have tested it constantly) to work with inferior Wools. From
a very long and tried experience I have the greatest confidence
in fully recommending Peacock Qualities; they are full
measure, and extra good. If washed according to the directions
I give, and not washed oftener than necessary, I have no doubt
of their wear. Little children’s knitted garments should always
be washed in the nursery, or at home. The following is an
admirable method; but, where it can be done, all Knitting and
Crochet should be “blocked” to dry. The “block” is a
piece of evenly-planed hard wood—generally box-wood—cut
the size and shape of the garment. In some cases the blocks
are earthenware. Little feet, and models of children’s legs and
feet, can be procured in nearly all sizes. The work, when
washed and wringed, but not wrung, must be drawn on the blocks
and left to dry quickly in a warm place.</p>

<hr class="r25">

<p class="center no-indent wsp fs120">TO WASH WOOL.</p>

<p>All fine Shetland, or other finely-combed and spun Wools,
should be washed in a lather of bran—<em>no</em> soap, unless very dirty.
A gallon of boiling water should be poured over 1 lb. of bran,
and the two stirred well together in a boiling state for five or
six minutes; leave it in a pancheon or basin all night; in the
morning pour off the water, make it lukewarm, wash your work
in it, then rinse in lukewarm clean soft water and block till dry.
Where you have not a block, cover a board with a clean cloth
and pin the work out to dry. If the work is much soiled, take
a little transparent soap (it is the most free from all injurious
matters), mix into a lather in a little warm water, and gently wash
the work in the lather (on no account rub the work with soap),
rinse in cold water, and block.</p>

<h2><em>TAM O’SHANTER CAP.</em></h2>

<p class="center no-indent">Knitted, for a Man.</p>

<p>You require 2 ozs. Navy Blue Eider Wool,
½ oz. Scarlet Single Berlin for the Tuft, 9 needles,
No. 15 for a very tight knitter, No. 16 for a loose
knitter. The cap knitted by these directions
measured 12 stitches to the inch, laid perfectly flat,
with no stretching whatever.</p>

<p>Cast 4 stitches on to one needle. Knit these off
on to 4 separate needles, using a 5th, and work
in rounds.</p>

<p>1st row—Knit plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>2nd row—Knit 2 stitches on each of the 4
needles. You work these by knitting 2 in each
stitch: knit the stitch, and before taking it from
the left needle put the right needle between the
two threads on the left needle, take up the back
part and knit a stitch on it. All the increasings in
the work are made in this manner.</p>

<p>3rd row—Knit plain.</p>

<p>4th row—Increase in the first stitch on each
needle.</p>

<p>5th row—Knit plain. Repeat these two rows
twice more.</p>

<p>10th row—Increase in every 3rd stitch.</p>

<p>11th, 12th and 13th rows—Knit plain. Repeat
these 4 rows 3 more times.</p>

<p>26th row—Increase in every 4th stitch.</p>

<p>27th, 28th, 29th and 30th rows, plain. Repeat
these 5 last rows 4 times.</p>

<p>51st row—Increase in every 5th stitch.</p>

<p>52nd and 4 next rows—Knit plain. Repeat
from the 51st row 5 more times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>86th row—Increase every 6th stitch. In this
round mark the beginning of the round with some
white thread, as it is essential to keep the rows
distinct. You will have to take more needles as
they fill. 7 rounds plain.</p>

<p>94th round—Increase every 7th stitch.</p>

<p>95th and 7 next rounds plain.</p>

<p>103rd round—Increase every 8th stitch.</p>

<p>104th and next 8 rounds plain.</p>

<p>113th round—Increase every 9th stitch. Knit
10 rounds plain.</p>

<p>124th round—Increase every 10th stitch. 10
rounds plain.</p>

<p>134th round—Increase every 11th stitch. 20
rounds plain.</p>

<p>164th round—Decrease by knitting 2 together
every 11th and 12th stitches. 10 rounds plain.</p>

<p>175th round—Knit together every 10th and 11th
stitches. 9 rounds plain.</p>

<p>185th round—Knit together every 9th and 10th
stitches. 9 rounds plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>193rd round—Knit together every 8th and 9th
stitches. 8 rounds plain.</p>

<p>201st round—Knit together every 7th and 8th
stitches. 7 rounds plain.</p>

<p>208th round—Knit together every 6th and 7th
stitches. 6 rows plain.</p>

<p>You now rib in alternate stitches of knit 1,
purl 1, knitting each stitch from the back of the
loop, 30 rows, and cast off.</p>

<p>The work must now be flattened, and shaped.
Cut a round of stiff cardboard slightly larger than
the work, put the work on the board and damp it,
leave it on the board until it is quite dry. You
line it with thin silk, and add the tuft.</p>

<p>The Tuft is made by winding the scarlet wool
over card. Take a piece of card, 1½ in. wide—it
must be smooth and strong—double over it a piece
of fine wire the length of the card. Over the
wire and the card wind the wool until the whole
is wound, take the ends of the wire and twist
the wool firmly and strongly together with it,
slip the wool off the card; this makes a firm,
compact tuft. You cut the top open, cut it
level with sharp scissors, and sew into the middle
of the hat.</p>

<h2><em>TAM O’SHANTER in Crochet.</em></h2>

<p>Work with two contrasting colours of the
Peacock A. A. Fingering, one skein of each, and a
fine bone crochet hook, No. 12. Make a chain of
8, with one colour only, unite.</p>

<p>2nd row—Work in double crochet.</p>

<p>3rd row—Work 2 double crochet in every
stitch.</p>

<p>4th row—Work each stitch in alternate colours,
passing the wool at the back from one to the
other, and increase in every 3rd stitch.</p>

<p>5th row—Plain.</p>

<p>6th row—Increase every 3rd stitch.</p>

<p>7th and 8th rows—Plain.</p>

<p>9th row—Increase every 3rd stitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>10th and 3 next rows—No increasings. Repeat
these 5 rows 5 more times.</p>

<p>34th row—Increase every 6th stitch. 4 rows
plain. Repeat these 5 rows until your work
measures 16 inches across, work 10 more plain
rounds, and from that round begin to decrease
every 6th stitch. This is done by taking up the
1st on the needle, then the 2nd, and working the
two as one. Four rounds plain; repeat these 5
rounds until your work from the last of the 10
plain rounds measures 4½ inches. You then take
up the stitches on 5 knitting needles, and knit 20
rounds, with one colour only, of 1 purl, 1 plain,
and cast off.</p>

<p>The Cap should be lined, and a tuft made in
the same manner as directed in the receipt for a
Knitted Cap.</p>

<h2><em>JACK TAR, for a Man.</em></h2>

<p class="center no-indent">In imitation of Plush.</p>

<p>In some of our shops this shape is wrongly sold
as the Tam O’Shanter; that shape is much larger,
and the <em>under</em> part much deeper than the Jack Tar.</p>

<p>This Cap has a very soft appearance, and is
light and warm. For a fancy dress use light pink,
blue, or cream; for general winter wear, maroon
or dark grey. You will require 5 oz. of Peacock
Fingering and a No. 12 hook: about the same
quantity of Peacock Lady Betty, and more if
Fleecy is used. If the work is <em>combed</em> after it is
finished, the Fleecy should be used, as it wastes
the wool.</p>

<p>Make a chain of 40 stitches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>1st row—Double crochet.</p>

<p>2nd row—Put the hook in the 1st stitch, wind
the wool over the hook and round the 1st finger of
the left hand twice, draw the loops on the needle
through the double crochet loop, and finish as usual.
Work the whole row in this manner.</p>

<p>3rd row—Turn and work in single crochet.</p>

<p>These two rows are worked throughout; repeat
them twice more. They will be called <em>one</em> row in
the remainder of the directions.</p>

<p>6th row—Work 8 stitches, turn, work back.</p>

<p>7th row—Work 8, and 4 more on the last long
row, turn, work back.</p>

<p>8th row—Work 12, and 4 more, turn, work back.
Work in this manner until all are raised, then work
3 more whole rows, working the 40 stitches. Repeat
from the 6th row until the work lies flat on the table
and meets easily. You will have to repeat it 9 more
times according to some workers, perhaps more
with a tight worker. When the top is finished and
joined together, you work round the outside edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of the work 6 rounds of loop crochet, work round
and round, and work 1 stitch on the stitch of the
preceding row, always taking up the two edges of
the stitch.</p>

<p>You now decrease for the under rim; this is not
very wide, the whole depth not being more than
1 inch. If the hat is being made as a special fit,
take the measure of the head, then measure the
work, and decrease gradually to the exact size;
6 rows of decreasings only are required. For an
ordinary hat, work for 6 rounds every 5th and 6th
stitches as one. After these rounds, you work 12
rounds of plain double crochet for the head. The
name of the wearer or a ship should be crocheted
into the band.</p>

<p>The letters should be drawn out on a piece of point
paper; this is divided into little squares 1-16th of an
inch in size. Then you take a coloured wool; each
square represents a stitch, the letters are worked in
red or gold, in double crochet, by simply passing the
wool used as the ground at the back of that used for
the letters. It makes a better effect to work the letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
by putting the needle into the stitch, pull the wool
through, the wool on the needle, put the needle into
the same stitch again, and draw through the wool
on the needle and through all the loops on the
needle. This stitch raises the work.</p>

<p>You must next cut the loops of wool open and
trim them neatly with a sharp pair of scissors, and
you have an exact imitation of fur.</p>

<p>The crochet work of the hat is now finished.
Quilt a lining and sew in the head. Cut a piece of
lining muslin, 3 doubles, for the brim (or a piece of
leather), sew inside the 12 rows of crochet for the
head, and add strings at the back.</p>

<p>A tassel of silk is made in the same way as the
tuft, and placed in the middle of the crown.</p>

<h2><em>DUNDEE BONNET.</em></h2>

<p>Knitted in red and black Victoria yarn, or
any other mixture; black Head-piece in crochet;
a crochet-hook, No. 14.; six needles, No. 14.</p>

<p>Make a chain with the crochet-hook, working
rather tightly, that will measure 22 inches. On
this work a row of single crochet, thus, * the
needle in the next stitch, draw the wool through
and through the loop on the hook; repeat from
*, at the end of the chain join to the first double
crochet. On this foundation work very tightly, 12
rows of crochet. Work each row with the same
stitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>1st row of Head-piece—The wool on the needle,
insert in the next stitch; draw the wool through,
and then through the three stitches on the needle.
When the 12 rows are finished, take up all the
stitches on five knitting needles, an equal number
on each; knit with the sixth. The 1st needle is
the first half of the back; the 2nd, the side; the
3rd, the front; the 4th needle, the second side;
the 5th, the last half of the back. Knit plain to
the middle of the 4th needle, turn, purl the stitches
to the middle of the 2nd needle, turn, slip the first,
* knit 1, purl 1; repeat from * to the middle of
the 4th needle, and increase in every 8th stitch;
knit 4 stitches less on the 4th needle than you
did before, * turn, purl the purled stitch of last row,
knit the knitted, and leave 4 less at the end of this
half-round. Repeat from *, increasing every 7th
stitch in every 3rd row, and leaving 3 stitches instead
of 4, as in the first repetition, then 2 stitches each
repetition, until you have one quarter of the stitches
left on the 3rd needle. You must now work all
these stitches, and, as you take up each set of two,
work an extra one on the side of the last, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
it and the first of the two next; knit the whole
round, increasing on the remainder of the 4th, 5th,
1st and 2nd needles, every 6th stitch. Work the
increasings by knitting 2 in one stitch, as directed
in the pattern, No. 1.</p>

<p>You must now knit in rounds, and increase every
alternate round in the 6th stitch until the knitting at
the back measures 1½ inches above the band. The
front must be 5½ inches deep; it will require some
more shaped rows, therefore, before you work the
last 6 rounds of the back. Work on the 2nd, 3rd and
4th needles as many more half-rows, repeating the
directions, until you have the right depth.</p>

<p>You now work the 6 rounds to finish the
Head-piece, increasing every 6th stitch in <em>each
alternate round</em>.</p>

<p>You next work 18 rounds with no decreasings;
then decrease for the crown.</p>

<p>The knitting, according to the work from which
this is written, measured 36 inches in circumference.
Make a decreasing every 16th and 17th stitch by
knitting those two stitches together; the 2nd and
3rd rounds no decreasings. Knit in this manner
until there are only 10 stitches on the needle, cast
these off with a row of double crochet, make a
rosette, and place in the centre; add ribbons
behind. Line the head with silk, and the band
with thin leather or double linen.</p>

<h2><em>BICYCLING OR PATROL CAP.</em></h2>

<p>Crocheted with Andalusian wool, and a fine
bone crochet hook; a knot of fine mohair cord, or
very fine black bobbin cord; the former is the best
for use. The whole of the crochet is worked over
this cord, which gives a raised appearance, and
makes the shape better.</p>

<p>Make a chain of 4, unite, draw the cord through
the chain, loop it securely over the cord and chain;
work 8 double crochet. The cord must, throughout
the work, be held in its place by the finger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and thumb of the left hand, keeping it at the edge
of the row, underneath and behind the needle.</p>

<p>2nd round—In the 8 double crochet work 16
treble. Take up all the stitches through <em>both</em> loops,
or your work will not have the ribbed appearance it
should have.</p>

<p>3rd round—Work 2 treble in every stitch.</p>

<p>4th and successive rounds—Work round and
round, increasing to keep the work flat, until you
have 15 rounds. You now commence the band
round the hat. In the first round you must slightly
tighten together the cord, as well as in succeeding
rounds, to keep it the right shape; work 9 rounds
for this head-band, and finish with 2 of double
crochet. You then line with black linen, and sew
in a piece of leather. Work a small round of crochet
to cover a button for the centre, and make a crochet
rosette to go round it.</p>


<h3><em>The Rosette.</em></h3>

<p>Make a chain of 8, unite.</p>

<p>In this work 1 chain, 1 double crochet, 8 times.</p>


<p>2nd round—1 double crochet in the first chain,
*2 treble on the double crochet, 1 double crochet
in the next chain; repeat from *.</p>

<p>3rd round—1 double crochet on the double
crochet, * 5 treble on the 2 treble, 1 double crochet
on the next double crochet, repeat from *. Take
the cord and work it round the next row.</p>

<p>4th round—* 1 double crochet on the double
crochet, 2 treble on the 1st treble, 1 long on the
2nd, 2 double long on the 3rd, 1 long and 1 treble
on the 4th, 1 treble on the 5th; repeat from *.</p>

<p>6th round—1 single on each stitch of last row.
This is laid on the middle of the hat and the button
placed in the centre.</p>

<h2><em>TARBUCH</em></h2>

<p>In black netting silk and gold thread.</p>

<p>The Tarbuch is taken from one worked in Egypt,
and is the correct shape. It is worked with very
fine purse silk, twelve skeins; Japanese or Chinese
gold thread, the finest size, wind this in balls; a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
crochet hook. The pattern consists of a star in the
centre of the crown: this star has 10 divisions, a
border of vine leaves round the edge, and powdered
ground.</p>

<p>Commence the crown with black silk, with a
chain of 4, unite; in this work 10 double crochet.</p>

<p>2nd round—In every stitch of last round work 1
black and 1 gold. In working with two colours
you should knot the two threads together in beginning,
and throughout the work hold both evenly over
the same finger of the left hand, then, as you proceed,
keep the thread <em>not</em> in use in regular rotation
over and under the thread in use; by this means
you work them in. Care must be taken <em>never</em> to
completely finish a stitch with the one colour; if it
<em>is</em> done you have <em>two</em> stitches of the colour and
throw the pattern wrong. In this 2nd round put
the needle into the stitch, draw through the <em>black</em>
silk, take up the <em>gold</em> and finish the stitch; take up
the next stitch with gold, finish it with black. You
have now two distinct stitches.</p>

one less worked each row on the left side. 3 black,
1 gold, 3 black over the 3 black and the last gold;
12 gold over the 12 gold.</p>

<p>20th round—Over the 13th gold and 7 black
work 9 black, 11 gold over 11.</p>

and the black work 11 black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>22nd round—9 gold over 9, 2 black, 1 gold, 7

<p>25th round—* 5 black, 3 gold, repeat from *.</p>

<p>26th and 27th rounds—Gold only, and fasten off.</p>

<p>This completes the Cap. It should, properly
speaking, be put upon a block; this may be made
of cardboard. Line the Cap through with a blue
satin lining, gathering it in at the top and sew over
neatly with a large button covered with satin. This
must not be sewn in until the tassel is passed
through.</p>

<h3><em>The Tassel.</em></h3>

<p>Wind the netting silk round a piece of cardboard
5 inches long, wind a sufficient quantity to
make it look handsome. Under the silk pass a
doubled length, and tie it all together very tightly,
slip it off the card, and wind two thicknesses of
silk firmly over the tied end for the depth of three-quarters
of an inch, leave an end about half a yard
long, thread a strong needle with this end, pass it
through the tassel, under the silk wound over, and
bring the needle out at the top; make a firm chain
of about 2 inches long with this silk.</p>

<p>You next crochet a covering for the top of the
tassel. This is worked in double crochet. Begin
with 5 chain, work 7 double crochet on it, on the 7
double crochet work 10, on the 10 work 14, and
increase until it will fit tightly over the silk you
have wound over; work the depth to cover the
winding, sew it down strongly. Pass the chain
through the foundation chain of the cap, and sew
very securely.</p>

<h2><em>FISHERMAN’S CAP, for a Man.</em></h2>

<p>One oz. of dark red, one oz. of gold wool.</p>

<p>These Caps should be knitted in stripes to suit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the Jersey, jacket, or shirt of the wearer. They are
knitted in Merino wool, or 2-fold Ice silk, on No. 17
needles. On a Lamb’s knitting machine use the
finest red silk; knit the Cap the full length in
stripes; then, on each side and in the middle,
decrease until you come to a point; sew this
together, and the hat is made.</p>

<p>To knit the Cap with the wool or silk named,
cast on on 4 needles 260 stitches with red wool, knit
16 rounds; change, take the gold, knit 16 rounds.
Knit 16 stripes in this manner, 8 of red, 8 of gold,
then begin to decrease for the top.</p>

<p>Black stripe—Knit 2, knit 2 together, knit 57,
knit 2 together, knit 4, knit 2 together, knit 57,
knit 2 together, knit 4, knit 2 together, knit 57,
knit 2 together, knit 4, knit 2 together, knit 57,
knit 2 together, knit 2.</p>

<p>Knit 3 rounds plain.</p>

<p>5th round—Knit like the first row in the black
stripe, but with 55 stitches between, instead of 57.
Work in this manner, with 3 plain rounds between
each round of decreasing, until you have 41 stitches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
between each set of decreasings, then decrease every
3rd round until you have only 27 on the needle
between the decreasings; after that, decrease every
alternate round until the decreased stitches come
close together; you then * knit 2, knit 2 together,
all round; repeat from *. In the next round knit 1,
* knit 3 together, knit 2, repeat from *; then decrease
by knitting 2 together every stitch until you have
a point. Make a tassel of the two colors, and sew
on to the point. Hem up the foundation round
inside the work, folding the knitting evenly in the
middle of the third black stripe.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This Cap can, of course, be knitted in any
material; the finer the wool, the more suitable.
The size must be determined by measuring the
head; knit a small piece of knitting of 20 stitches
square with the materials you intend to use, and
measure this with a tape measure. A simple multiplication
of the number of stitches you have in an
inch will enable you at once to cast on the required
number of stitches, then work as directed. A very
handsome Cap is made by using a combination of
colors. Commence with black, ¼-inch, 3 rounds
of red, 1 of gold, 2 of blue, 1 of gold, 2 of red, 3 of
gold, 2 of red, 1 of gold, 5 of blue, 1 of gold, 2 of
red, 3 of gold, 2 of red, 1 of gold, 2 of blue, 1 of
gold, 3 of red, 20 of black, then commence the red
again for one or two more stripes, and work the
remainder of the Cap in one color, or continue
it in stripes.</p>

manner until you have 7 rounds of raised work,
which will make the cap the right shape; it should
be 6½ to 7 inches in diameter. Then continue the
same with no decreasings for the band round the
head; you require 4 rows of patterns for this.
Finish the work with 2 rounds of black silk. Line
the cap, add a piece of leather round the edge, and
put a button, covered with double crochet worked
in gold silk, in the centre.</p>

the work is nearly 7 inches across. This will allow
the size to be just under 21 inches; about 22½ is
a usual size in hats. The brim of the hat is increased
very gradually indeed. Work 4 rounds with
no increasings; in the next, divide the work into
quarters; work an extra stitch in beginning each
quarter; and do the same every 3rd round, which
will give the brim the desired slope. When you
have worked the top, work round and round, with
no increasings, for 6 rounds; then take the contrasting
colour and work 1½ inches of it; fasten off.
Work another small round of the same stitch in this
colour, cover a large button or curtain ring with it,
and place at the top of the cap. Line the crown
and sides with black silk, and sew a piece of leather,
3 inches deep, round the rim.</p>
